# Research-Management-System
I have created this project for my degree. This project contains many uses based on the industry. 

It uses Pyhton, HTMl, CSS AND JS as frontend and as for backend and database I used XAMPP. 
This project allows us to approve the research papers and provide them certificates. It's the best for non-contact approval. Both Students and teachers can apply for research papers. Only admin can approve. 
Once the research papers are thoroughly approved the admin can send a certificate which is based on automation. It automatically sends the approval and the certificate to the particular person through the email. 
The login contains email and password and as for account creation just basically information is required about the person and it allows us to change the password if forgotten.
